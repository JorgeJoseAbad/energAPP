## An application to visualize and work with energy data primary obtained from Spanish Electric Network.

This application downloads data through the Spanish Electric Network API.
https://api.esios.ree.es/ in order to show these data, and perform calculations on them.

Through an own API it will store in BBDD the results of relevant calculations to be able to present them independently.

Front technology: Angular 6, Chart.js, Blob, Bootstrap 4 for Angular.
Back technology: node.js, express, mongoDB..
